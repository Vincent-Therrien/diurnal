Diurnal Demonstration Repository
================================

This repository contains demonstrative scripts that use the ``diurnal`` library
to automate RNA secondary structure operations. To use them, first install the
library. You can then execute a script with the following command:

.. block:: bash

   python <script name>

where ``<script name>`` is the file name of the script to execute. Note that:

- ``preprocessing_demo.py`` should be ran first to download and format data.
- ``cnn_demo.py`` and ``mlp_interfamily_demo.py`` can be executed afterward.
